## Prime number
- Prime Number: whole number greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.
	- A factor is a whole numbers that can be divided evenly into another number.
- To make N a prime number, it must not be divided by a natural number which is equal or greater than 2 and equal or less than N-1
- for example) prime numbers between 1 and 100
	- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
- when i want to know if a number is a prime number
	- it is needed to check if there are any factor between 2 to N-1
    	- it is actually inspected between 2 to N/2
        	- because maximum factor could be N/2
            - N can be expressed like a times b and minimum value of a is 2
            	- so b can't be greater than N/2
                - N = a * b and 2 * N/2
    - it can be inspected by calculating mod
	- minimum difference between a and b is root N
    	- N = a * b, when N is not a prime number
        	- if a >= root N and b >= root N, a * b > N
- code for finding if a number is prime.
```java
	bool prime(int n) {
      if ( n < 2 ) {
        return false;
      }
      for (int i=2; i*i<=n; i++) {
        // i <= root N to i*i <= N
        // multiplying both sides by i
        if ( n % i == 0 ) {
          return false; 
        }
      }
      
      return true;
    }
```
- Big O is Root N

## Finding Prime numbers
- boj.kr/1978
- it can be implmented as it mentioned above
- code implementation
	```java
    import java.io.BufferedReader;
    import java.io.IOException;
    import java.io.InputStreamReader;

    public class Main {

        public static int isPrime(int n) {

            if(n < 2)
                return 0;
            if(n == 2)
                return 1;
            else if(n%2 == 0)
                return 0;

            for(int i=3; i*i<=n; i++){
                if(n%i == 0)
                    return 0;
            }

            return 1;
        }

        public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {

            BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            String n = br.readLine();
            String[] ns = br.readLine().split(" ");
            int sum = 0;

            for(int i=0; i<ns.length; i++)
                sum += isPrime(Integer.parseInt(ns[i]));

            System.out.print(sum);

        }
    }
	```

## How to find prime numbers faster
- originally, Big O was O(sqrt(N))
- about time complexity
	- when N = 1,000,000
    	- sqrt(N) = 1,000
    - when N = 100,000,000
    	- sqrt(N) = 10,000
	- when we find all prime numbers between 1 and 1,000,000
    	- check if each one is prime number 
        - it takes about 10 seconds to check all prime numbers between 1 and 1,000,000
        - amount of numbers are N so it will take O (N sqrt(N)) time complexity
		- it takes too long

## Sieve of Eratosthenes
- use the algorithm of sieve of Eratosthenes
- to get all prime numbers between 1 and N
- how it works
	1. write all numbers between 2 to N (N >= 2)
    2. find minimum number among remaining numbers
    3. that number is a prime number 
    4. erase all the multiple of the number
