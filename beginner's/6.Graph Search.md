## Search of Graph
- There are two kinds of way to search graph
	- DFS and BFS
    	- DFS
        	- Depth First Search Algorithm
            - Search graph as deeply and many as it can
            - It uses Stack
    	- BFS
        	- Breadth First Search Algorithm
            - Search graph as broadly as it can
			- It uses Queue
            - When all edges' weight is 1
            	- it becomes the algorithm for getting shortest distance
- Purpose of graph search (DFS, BFS)
	- To visit all vertices once
- Algorithm of DFS
	- by using stack, it goes as much as it can
    - when there is no way to go, it goes back to a previous vertex
	- example)
    	- first, to check if this vertex is already visited
        - it's good to make array for remembering the vertex number it visited.
			- i ........... 1 2 3 4 5 6
            - check[i] 1 0 0 0 0 0
            	- it is a first state. start point is 1 and it is not moving yet
                - when all of check array's value have value of 1, this algorithm will be over.

			- when graph's state is like this, it can move any direction (2 or 5).
			- but in this case, we will make this go to smaller number first.

			- so it went to number 2
            - and array will be like
				- i ........... 1 2 3 4 5 6
				- check[i] 1 1 0 0 0 0
			- vertex of this point : 2
            - order : 1 2
            - stack : 1 2

			- vertex of this point : 3
   				- i ........... 1 2 3 4 5 6
				- check[i] 1 1 1 0 0 0
            - order : 1 2 3
            - stack : 1 2 3

			- vertex of this point : 4
				- i ........... 1 2 3 4 5 6
				- check[i] 1 1 1 1 0 0
            - order : 1 2 3 4
            - stack : 1 2 3 4
	![DFS5.png](https://images.velog.io/post-images/jakeseo_me/bcd22160-4587-11e9-9f27-93b0ed02db16/DFS5.png)
			- vertex of this point : 5
				- i ........... 1 2 3 4 5 6
				- check[i] 1 1 1 1 1 0
            - order : 1 2 3 4 5
            - stack : 1 2 3 4 5
            - in this case, it has to go back to go to vertex 6
            	- by using stack, it can trace the number of vertices it has stopped by at
                - after popping stack it will go to vertex number 4

			- vertex of this point : 5
				- i ........... 1 2 3 4 5 6
				- check[i] 1 1 1 1 1 0
            - order : 1 2 3 4 5 6
            - stack : 1 2 3 4 6
			- it's all over now
            	 - once it over, people can know it's over but
                 - stack goes popping one by one
                 - after stack : 1 2 3 4
                 	- it can know that there is no vertex to go.
                    	- it is judged by checking if array 'check[i]'s value is 1 or 0
                        - only if the value is 0, we can go to that number of vertex
                    - it should pop the stack out
                 - after stack : 1 2 3
                 - after stack : 1 2
                 - after stack : 1
                 - after stack : empty
	- implement of DFS
