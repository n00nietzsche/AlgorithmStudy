- it's a type of datastructure
- it has Node and Vertex(정점), Edge(간선)
	- Vertex and Node mean same thing. Circled ones in the image.
	- Edge means lines connecting circles.
    	- This represents the relationship between vertices.
- G = (V, E)
- for example) on facebook
	- friends are vertices
    - relationships are edges

- it has 5 Vertices and 7 Edges
- Path from A to B
	- A->C->D->E->B
    - A->B
    - A->C->B
    - A->C->E->B

## Cycle in Graph
- This refers to a case where the origin and destination are the same.
	- A to A
    - B to B
- Cycle about A to A
	- A->C->B->A
    - A->C->E->B->A
    - A->C->D->E->B->A
