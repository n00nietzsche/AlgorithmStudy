## Representation of Graph
![Graph_Expression1.png](https://images.velog.io/post-images/jakeseo_me/bb1f4680-44b1-11e9-b48b-71dfd1830523/GraphExpression1.png)
- in case of this graph, it has 6 vertices and 8 edges
- it doesn't have direction so it is undirected graph
- vertices : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- edges : {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)}
- vertices are usually named just 1 to the amount of vertices
	- so edges are important
    - we only save the amount of vertices by using variable.
- if we just want to express graph, it is the same to just save the all of edges.
	- edge can save effectively
    	- we can figure out the graph's representation

## Adjacency Matrix (Without Weight)
- When you say the number of vertices is V
	- We use 2 dimension array which has size of V * V 
- A[i][j] = 1 (when there is edge connecting i to j), 0 (no edge)
- in case of graph at the top, it can be expressed like this
```
/ 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
2 1 0 1 1 1 0
3 0 1 0 1 0 0
4 0 1 1 0 1 1
5 1 1 0 1 0 0
6 0 0 0 1 0 0
```
- These numbers are symmetrical in relation of the diagonal
- it has dis-advantage
	- it saves useless edges
    	- even if it doesn't have any edge, it saves 0 in that space
- usually, V^2 >= E
- to solve easy problems, it is good way to express graph data structure.
	```c++
	#include <cstdio>
	#include <vector>
	int a[10][10];
	int main() {
      int n, m;
      scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
      for (int i=0; i<m; i++){
        int u, v;
        scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
        a[u][v] = a[v][u] = 1; // it means undirected graph
      }
    }
	```

## Adjacency Matrix (With Weight)
![Graph_Expression2.png](https://images.velog.io/post-images/jakeseo_me/9c9e9d70-44b9-11e9-a7a4-4f4044b4f0ac/GraphExpression2.png)
- it is similar to that of undirected grpah
- but when it is saved it doesn't just save 1 but its weight
- A[i][j] = w (there is edge connecting from i to j), 0 (no edge)
- if range of w is -9999 <= w <= 9999, we can make 2 arrays.
	- one expresses edges connecting vertices
    - another expresses weight of edges
	- graph above can be expressed like this.
```
/ 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 0 2 0 0 7 0
2 2 0 2 3 1 0
3 0 2 0 1 0 0
4 0 3 1 0 7 7
5 7 1 0 7 0 0
6 0 0 0 7 0 0
```
- code
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
int a[10][10];
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i=0; i<m; i++){
    int u, v;
    scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
    a[u][v] = a[v][u] = 1; // it means undirected graph
  }
}
```

## Adjacency List (Without Weight)
- implement using linked-list
- in A[i], there are linked lists which is connected with 'i'
![Graph_Expression3.png](https://images.velog.io/post-images/jakeseo_me/12250890-44bf-11e9-81a2-1bc7f707d57d/GraphExpression3.png)
- in this case,
	- A[1]: 2 5
    - A[2]: 1 3 4 5
    - A[3]: 2 4
    - A[4]: 3 5 2 6
    - A[5]: 1 2 4
    - A[6]: 4
    	- the numbers in array actually doesn't mean vertex but edges
		- the amount of its numbers means 'degree'
- it needs space of O(E)
- since LinkedList takes too much time to implement, it is usually implemented with vector in which length can be changed
- it is used to use space only needed
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
vector<int> a[10]; // it is different from expression like a(10)
				   // a[10] means 10 of 2 dimension array which has changable size
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {
    int u, v;
    scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
    a[u].push_back(v); // it means undirected graph
    a[v].push_back(u);
  }
}
```

## Adjacency List (With weight)
- it saves edges and weight like below
	- A[1]: (2, 2) (5, 7)
    - A[2]: (1, 2) (3, 2) (4, 3) (5, 1)
    - A[3]: (2, 2) (4, 1)
    - A[4]: (3, 1) (5, 7) (2, 3) (6, 7)
    - A[5]: (1, 7) (2, 1) (4, 7)
    - A[6]: (4, 7)
- implementation
```c++
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
vector<pair<int, int>> a[10];
int main() {
  int n, m;
  scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
  for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {
    int u, v, w;
    scanf("%d %d %d", &u, &v, &w);
    a[u].push_back(make_pair(v, w));
    a[v].push_back(make_pair(u, w));
  }
}
```

## Space Complexity of Adjacency Matrix and List
- Adjacency Matrix : O(V^2)
- Adjacency List : O(E)
	- in most cases, we don't need much space for edges
    - so adjacency list is usually right choice to use

## Edge-list
- it is implemented by using array
- it saves all of edges
- for example)
	- E[0] = 1 2
    - E[1] = 1 5
    - E[2] = 2 3
    - ....
    	- each means start point of edge and end point of edge
- if there are 8 edges and the graph is undirected, to implement this, we need 16 spaces
- it should be sorted start point of edge first
- after sorting there should be array like this.
	- i .... 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
    - cnt[i] 0 2 4 2 4 3 1
    - it means the number of edges in the graph
- implementation
```c++
for (int i=0; i<m; i++) {
  cnt[e[i][0]] += 1;
}
```
- after getting the number of all edges to N
- accumulate like this again
	- i .... 0  1  2  3  4  5  6
    - cnt[i] 0  2  6  8 12 15 16
- implementation
```c++
for (int i=1; i<=n; i++) {
  cnt[i] = cnt[i-1] + cnt[i];
}
```
- after this, amazing thing happens
	- the range from cnt[i-1] to cnt[i]-1 means that E[cnt[i-1] to E[cnt[i]-1] is the range of the edge number i
	- for example)
    	- edges of vertex 1 exists from E[0] to E[1]
        	- 0 = cnt[i-1], 1 = cnt[i]-1

## meaning of Saving Graph
- it means we want to save edges
- there are three ways
	- adjacency matrix
    	- ineffective
    - adjacency list
    - edge list
