- It is possible that graphs are divided into few pieces
- like this, if graphs are separated, it is called connected component
- There should be path to connect all vertices in each connected component
- Also, there should be no path to connect vertices in other connected components to become a connected component
- Graph above has two of connected component
- to get connected component, we can use BFS or DFS search
