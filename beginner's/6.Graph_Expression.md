## Representation of Graph

- in case of this graph, it has 6 vertices and 8 edges
- it doesn't have direction so it is undirected graph
- vertices : {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- edges : {(1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 5), (2, 3), (3, 4), (2, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)}
- vertices are usually named just 1 to the amount of vertices
	- so edges are important
    - we only save the amount of vertices by using variable.
- if we just want to express graph, it is the same to just save the all of edges.
	- edge can save effectively
    	- we can figure out the graph's representation

## Adjacency Matrix (Without Weight)
- When you say the number of vertices is V
	- We use 2 dimension array which has size of V * V 
- A[i][j] = 1 (when there is edge connecting i to j), 0 (no edge)
- in case of graph at the top, it can be expressed like this
```
/ 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 0 0 0 0 1 0
2 1 0 1 1 1 0
3 0 1 0 1 0 0
4 0 1 1 0 1 1
5 1 1 0 1 0 0
6 0 0 0 1 0 0
```
- These numbers are symmetrical in relation of the diagonal
- it has dis-advantage
	- it saves useless edges
    	- even if it doesn't have any edge, it saves 0 in that space
- usually, V^2 >= E
- to solve easy problems, it is good way to express graph data structure.
	```c++
	#include <cstdio>
	#include <vector>
	int a[10][10];
	int main() {
      int n, m;
      scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);
      for (int i=0; i<m; i++){
        int u, v;
        scanf("%d %d", &u, &v);
        a[u][v] = a[v][u] = 1; // it means undirected graph
      }
    }
	```

## Adjacency Matrix (With Weight)

- it is similar to that of undirected grpah
- but when it is saved it doesn't just save 1 but its weight
- A[i][j] = w (there is edge connecting from i to j), 0 (no edge)
- if range of w is -9999 <= w <= 9999, we can make 2 arrays.
	- one expresses edges connecting vertices
    - another expresses weight of edges
	- graph above can be expressed like this.
```
/ 1 2 3 4 5 6
1 0 2 0 0 7 0
2 2 0 2 3 1 0
3 0 2 0 1 0 0
4 0 3 1 0 7 7
5 7 1 0 7 0 0
6 0 0 0 7 0 0
```
